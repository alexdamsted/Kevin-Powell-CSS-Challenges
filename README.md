# Kevin-Powell-CSS-Challenges
The purpose of this project is to teach me how to build layouts properly, espicially with flexbox. Kevin Powell is an incredible CSS developer, these are challenges from his 21 day drip-fed course about creating responsive layouts. The solution to a challenge is released one to two days after completing said challenge.
